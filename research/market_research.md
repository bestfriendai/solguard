# SoloGuard — Market Research

## Problem Statement

Solo travelers, remote workers, elderly individuals, and anyone spending time alone faces a critical safety gap: if something happens to them, no one knows. Traditional safety apps focus on emergency buttons (requiring conscious action) or location tracking (privacy-invasive), but there's no simple "I'm okay" check-in system that automatically escalates if the user goes silent.

## Market Opportunity

### Target Demographics

1. **Solo Travelers** (25-45)
   - Backpackers, digital nomads, adventure tourists
   - High risk scenarios: remote locations, new cities, hostels
   - Size: 150M+ solo trips/year globally

2. **Elderly Living Alone** (65+)
   - Falls, medical emergencies, isolation
   - Adult children want peace of mind
   - Size: 100M+ in US/EU alone

3. **Remote Workers** (25-55)
   - Work from coffee shops, coworking spaces
   - Unpredictable schedules, new environments
   - Size: 50M+ globally

4. **Nightlife/Social** (18-35)
   - Late nights, dates, parties
   - Risk of unsafe situations
   - Size: Large addressable market

### Market Size

- Total Addressable Market (TAM): $2.5B+
- Serviceable Available Market (SAM): $500M+
- Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM): $50M+ (Year 1)

### Market Trends

1. **Safety apps growing 25% YoY** — Post-pandemic, personal safety is top of mind
2. **Solo travel at all-time high** — 2024-2025 record solo travelers
3. **Aging population** — 78M Baby Boomers in US, most live independently
4. **Subscription fatigue** — Users willing to pay for genuine safety

## Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitors

| App | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|-----|-----------|------------|
| Noonlight | Professional monitoring | Expensive ($30/mo), emergency-focused |
| bSafe | Location sharing | Clunky UI, dated design |
| Life360 | Family tracking | Privacy-invasive, "spy" feel |
| Kitestring | Simple check-ins | Basic, no app, limited features |

### Positioning Gap

Current solutions either:
1. Require constant location tracking (privacy violation)
2. Cost $20-30/month (too expensive)
3. Feel "scary" or emergency-focused (user reluctance)
4. Are too complex (feature bloat)

**SoloGuard Opportunity**: Simple, friendly, affordable ($5-10/mo), check-in based (not tracking), modern UX.

## Value Proposition

### For Users
- **Peace of mind** — Knowing someone will check on you
- **Non-invasive** — No constant tracking, just a daily tap
- **Affordable** — Premium at $4.99/mo or $29.99/yr
- **Friendly** — Not scary, feels like a safety net, not surveillance

### For Families
- **No spying** — They get alert only if something wrong
- **Set and forget** — Schedule reminders for loved ones
- **Low friction** — One tap to confirm "I'm okay"

## Revenue Model

| Tier | Price | Features |
|------|-------|----------|
| Free | $0 | 2 contacts, 2 schedules, basic history |
| Premium | $4.99/mo | Unlimited contacts/schedules, location sharing, custom intervals |
| Annual | $29.99/yr | Same as premium, 50% savings |

**Projected ARPU**: $3.50/month (mix of free/premium)

| Privacy concerns | Medium | Transparent data policy, no tracking |
| Competition | Medium | First-mover in "friendly check-in" space |
