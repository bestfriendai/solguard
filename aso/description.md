# SoloGuard — Your Safety Net

SoloGuard is the friendly check-in app that keeps you safe without invading your privacy. Perfect for solo travelers, remote workers, elderly individuals, or anyone who wants peace of mind.

## How It Works

**1. Check In**
Tap a button to confirm you're safe. Takes just one second.

**2. Set a Schedule**
Choose when you want to check in — morning, evening, or custom times. 

**3. Add Emergency Contacts**
Let your trusted contacts know they'll be notified if you miss a check-in.

**4. Stay Protected**
If you don't check in, your contacts receive an alert with your last known status.
